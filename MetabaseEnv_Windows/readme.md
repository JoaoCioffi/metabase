# Works for open-source editions

* To access the open-source version you can follow the instructions here: https://www.metabase.com/start/oss/
* In my case I'm running via Java (.JAR files), in a localhost application of Metabase

## To run via JAR:

1. Via terminal
```
java -jar metabase.jar
```
2. or simply run 'runJAR.bat' script
